# Next Steps for API Key Integration

This project uses environment variables stored in `.env` for all secrets.

## Required Keys
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` – existing key for GPT-4 interactions.
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` – key for Gemini API (if used).
- `BLOG_INSPECTOR_TOKEN` – token for authenticating requests to the Blog Inspector service.

Add any new keys to `.env` and document them here with brief setup instructions.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values.
2. For new services, append the key name and usage notes here.

Commit this file whenever new integrations are added so changes are tracked.
